# Nizam

**Nizam** is a small, self-contained **X11** desktop environment designed around predictability, stability, and a coherent user experience rather than configurability for its own sake. The project deliberately favors explicit behavior, bounded resource usage, and long-running session stability over visual effects or dynamic composition. **Nizam** targets users who value low latency, minimal background activity, and a traditional desktop model that remains readable and modern without relying on a compositor.

The environment is built as a set of clearly separated components with well-defined responsibilities. The **X11** layer is provided by **nizam-panel** and **nizam-dock**, both implemented without **GTK** and designed to remain resident with stable memory usage and near-zero CPU consumption at idle. Application-level functionality is provided by **GTK3** programs such as **nizam-explorer**, **nizam-terminal**, **nizam-text**, and **nizam-settings**, which share a consistent visual language and interaction model. Each component is intentionally scoped, with internal caching always bounded and lifecycle ownership made explicit to ensure predictable behavior over time.

Visual consistency is achieved by aligning all **GTK3** applications with the **Adwaita** theme, while **X11** components are styled to match it closely. **GTK** appearance is managed exclusively through **GSettings**, avoiding per-application configuration files and unintended state drift. Panel and dock behavior are intentionally conservative: defaults are chosen to be stable, and customization is limited to what can be supported without introducing polling, unbounded caches, or hidden background work.

**Nizam** does not depend on a **compositor** and does not attempt to emulate modern composited desktops. This is a deliberate architectural choice that allows the system to remain responsive on modest hardware, reduces latency, and keeps the runtime model easy to reason about. Memory usage and CPU behavior are continuously measured, with explicit performance guardrails and tooling used to detect regressions during development.

The project documentation is split across [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md), [USAGE.md](USAGE.md), and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) covers build and deployment, [USAGE.md](USAGE.md) describes day-to-day interaction and defaults, and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) documents coding standards, performance constraints, and architectural rules intended to preserve the deterministic nature of the system as it evolves.

**Nizam** is not intended to be everything to everyone. It is a focused desktop environment that prioritizes clarity, restraint, and verifiable behavior, and it is developed with the assumption that simplicity, when enforced consistently, leads to robustness.
